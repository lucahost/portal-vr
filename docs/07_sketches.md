Flying menu on one side of each level.

Pros: 
- easy to use
- user can recognise it immediately  

Cons: 
- not that fancy
- user my not reach it on any time

### Menu as Watch

Menu wrapt in a wristwatch, whitch pops out when looking at it.

Pors: 
- user can reach it at any time
- fancy

Cons: 
- Needs more time to implement

We have decided to implement the wristwatch. The template already exists which saves us a lot of work.


## Simple Room Level

A level will look something like this. A floor with four walls to keep in player in its place.
